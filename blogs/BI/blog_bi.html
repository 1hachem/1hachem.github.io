						<h2>Problem statement</h2>
						<p>
						The unemployed are defined as people without work but actively seeking employment and currently available to start work.
						we see that unemployment rate world wide (the percentage of unemployed 25-64 year-olds among 25-64 year-olds in the labor force)
						is inversely correlated to the education level, which makes sense, the higher your educational level the more your chances are to be employed, right ?!

					<blockquote>
					Eurostat commenting on this chart : “As such, it would appear that apprenticeships and other kinds of education programs that equip students with the knowledge, know-how, 
					skills and/or competences required for a particular occupation increase the likelihood of recent graduates being able to find a job.”
					</blockquote>

					<p>
					however, data from 2019 shows that the unemployment rate world wide is pretty different than it is in Algeria (surprise surprise !).
					In 2019, the unemployment rate among people with higher education in Algeria corresponded to 17.4% percent. This educational level presented the highest unemployment rate in the country. 
					On the contrary, only three percent of the people in the labor force who did not pursue any educational degree were unemployed. Indeed, in that year, better-educated people were less likely to be employed in the country.

					<p>
					this effect may be due to many factors ( the employment market in Algeria, lack of open positions so on so forth), 
					but the issue that we aim to address here is what we believe to be a solid reason for this. 

  					we believe that graduated student often go unprepared to the professional world, 
					lacking insights about available companies in their fields, and having little to no information about the competition and market requirements.<br />

						<h2>Objectives</h2>
						<p><b>Insights</b><br />
						as we presented earlier <b>problem statement</b>, graduates have little to no information about the 
						available companies in their field, the properties of each company, how likely this company is going to hire, <br />
						what are the best options available in the market, and how much one should be paid for a role or another.
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Objectives</b><br/>
						we want is create an end to end BI tool that would help graduate student gain insights about the hiring market, <br/>
						and help them reach data driven decision and answer the following questions :
						</p>

						<ul class="alt">
							<li>is this company suitable for me ?</li>
							<li>who are its competitors ?</li>
							<li>what are the chances of me being hired ?</li>
							<li>how much should I be paid for this role ?</li>
						</ul>

								<b>Deliverables</b><br/>
								for this we plan on meeting the following deliverables :
