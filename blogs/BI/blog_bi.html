						<h2>Problem statement</h2>
						<p>
							unemployment is a serious problem that society suffers from, it has costs to a society that are more than just financial. 
							Even though unemployment is caused by various reasons coming from both the demand side (employers) and the supply side (workers) we are 
							going to investigate its relationship with educational levels both worldwide and in Algeria.

						<b>Unemployment</b> is a term referring to individuals who are employable and actively seeking a job but are unable to find one.

					<p>
						Readers with keen eyes will notice from the chart above that unemployment rate worldwide is inversely correlated to educational level, 
						which makes sense, the higher your educational level the more your chances are to be employed, right ?!
					</p>
					</header> 

					<blockquote>
					Eurostat commenting on this chart : “As such, it would appear that apprenticeships and other kinds of education programs that equip students with the knowledge, know-how, 
					skills and/or competences required for a particular occupation increase the likelihood of recent graduates being able to find a job.”
					</blockquote>

					<p>
					However, data from 2019 shows that the unemployment rate worldwide is pretty different than it is in Algeria (surprise surprise !).
					In 2019, the unemployment rate among people with higher education in Algeria corresponded to 17.4% percent. This educational level presented the highest unemployment rate in the country. 
					On the contrary, only three percent of the people in the labor force who did not pursue any educational degree were unemployed. Indeed, in that year, better-educated people were less likely to be employed in the country.

						This anomaly may be due to many factors (high interest rates, global recession, financial crisis and so on). 
						another factor which is generally overlooked and we believe to be a solid point is that; graduated student often go <b>unprepared</b> to the professional world, 
						<b>lacking insights</b> about available companies in their fields,
						and having little to <b>no information</b> about the <b>competition</b> and <b>market requirements</b>, which greatly affect their ability to find jobs and compete in the market.

						<h2>Objectives</h2>
						in this project we aim to create an end to end BI tool that would help graduated students gain insights about the hiring market, <br/>
						and enable them of making data driven decisions for that regard, and answer their questions :
						</p>

						<ul class="alt">
							<li>What companies out there are working in my domain ? </li>
							<li>Is this company suitable for me ?</li>
							<li>Who are its competitors ?</li>
							<li>What are the chances of me being hired ?</li>
							<li>How much should I be paid for this role ?</li>
						</ul>
					</header>
					</section>

						

						<section class="main special">
						<header class="major">
							<p>
								for a starting point our tool will contain the following 2 modules : 
							</p>

							<p><b>1.</b> A dashboard enabling the comparison between different companies in each industry, 
							this dashboard will visualize growth metrics and other performance indexes of each company.<br/>
							With this dashboard the user can identify the top tier companies in each domain, and find suitable ones for future employment.

						<h2>Proposed methodology</h2>
						<ul class="alt">
							<li>Data collection : we will implement 2 scrapping scripts, one that will scrap data from 
								<a href="https://craft.co/search?layout=list&order=relevance&q=">craft.co</a> and the other will scrap contacts from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">linkedin</a>
								these scripts will be wrote in python using the <code>selenium</code> library.</li>
							<li>Data storage and pipelines : data about companies and contacts will be stored in csv files, additional pipeline will be added to enable searching for new companies (new domains), 
								which will will execute the scrapping scripts and update the csv files. (we use pandas to write and read csv files)</li>
							<li>Data preparation : data cleaning and removing outliers + ETL + feature engineering for insights. </li>
							<li>Data visualization and dashboard : we want our dashboards to be interactive and friendly to the eyes, for this we will use <code>plotly</code> and implement our dashboards as a 
								web interface using <code>html</code>, <code>js</code> and <code>css</code></li>
